#+title: Fabb

A babashka-tasks porcelain inside emacs.

*** Development
Doom looks for local packages in two dirs, including ~/.doom.d/{local-repo}.

A symlink to there, plus the following in package.el addition, then a doom sync
worked for me.

#+begin_src sh
# linux
ln -s ~/.doom.d/fabb ~/teknql/fabb

# osx
ln -s ~/teknql/fabb ~/.doom.d/fabb
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; doom packages.el
(package! fabb :recipe (:local-repo "fabb" :build (:not compile)))
#+end_src

Then you can configure fab like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; doom config.el
(map!
 (:leader :desc "Fabb Status" :nv "f" #'fabb-status))

(use-package! fabb
  :config
  (map!
   (:map fabb-mode-map
    :n "/" #'fabb-invoke-ivy
    :n "?" #'fabb-dispatch)))
#+end_src

Configuring from the doom config fixes some common bindings issues, given that
many of the bindings get overwritten by doom/evil/etc, and it doesn't seem worth
adding hacks into fabb to work around that.
