#+title: Fabb

* todo
** [ ] `q` in process buffers should return to the fabb buffer
don't kill the process buffer
just return and move cursor to the current buffer's task/cursor/index/line number
** [ ] document suggested workflows
** [ ] handle bindings 'properly'
emacs modes and keybindings are layered and complicated
** [ ] document/handle dependencies
Things may only work due to implicit deps in my config right now

The linter led me to require these:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 's)
(require 'parseedn)
(require 'compile)
(require 'ivy)
(require 'evil)
(require 'cl-lib)
#+end_src

Not all of these are strictly necessary
** [ ] don't run ivy for non-ivy users
* sparks
** spark: fabb-narrow vs fabb-widen
enter to go into a task buffer
q to return to the all-tasks buffer

ideally we show output from running tasks, or open task buffers in splits along
the way

fabb narrow is sort of a fabb-focus
fabb widen is a return to the overview
